Master is the account that is an automatic admin, adding other admins is highly recommended with the /admin command as they can then post whatever they want including links etc.:

 /**
  * @type {!( number | string | (number|string)[] )}
  * ID (number) or username (string) of master,
  * the person who can promote and demote admins,
  * and add the bot to groups.
  */
 master: '@w1kke’,

The bot token is acquired from the Bot Father - which name do you want for the bot btw?

 /**
  * @type {!string}
  * Telegram Bot token obtained from https://t.me/BotFather.
  */
 token: ‘',


You can log the errors to a chat - I don’t use that:
  /**
   * @type {(number | false)}
   * Chat to send report notifications to.
   * Pass false to disable this feature.
   */
  report: false,

These delete settings are used by SingularityNET and Ocean - it makes the chat cleaner:
 /**
  * @type {( 'all' | 'own' | 'none' )}
  * Which messages with commands should be deleted?
  * Defaults to 'own' -- don't delete commands meant for other bots.
  */
 deleteCommands: 'all',

 deleteCustom: {
  longerThan: 450, // utf16 characters
  after: '20 minutes'
 },

 /**
  * @type {(ms | false)} Millisecond
  * Timeout before removing join and leave messages.
  * [Look at typedef above for details.]
  * Pass false to disable this feature.
  */
 deleteJoinsAfter: '0',

 /**
  * @type {(ms | { auto: (ms | false), manual: (ms | false) } | false)}
  * Timeout before removing auto-warn messages.
  * [Look at typedef above for details.]
  * Pass an object with { auto, manual } for more granular control
  * over which messages get deleted
  * Pass false to disable this feature.
  */
 deleteWarnsAfter: {manual: "2 minutes", auto: "2 minutes"},

 /**
  * @type {(ms | false)}
  * Timeout before removing ban messages.
  * [Look at typedef above for details.]
  * Pass false to disable this feature.
  */
 deleteBansAfter: "1 minute”,


This is the black- and whitelisting from Ocean, basically you are setting the ground rules for the links that can be posted without any complications. Other links will be deleted and the user gets a warning:

 /**
  * @type {string[]}
  * List of blacklisted domains.
  * Messages containing blacklisted domains will automatically be warned.
  * If the link is shortened, an attempt will be made to resolve it.
  * If resolved link is blacklisted, it will be warned for.
  */
 blacklistedDomains: [],

 /**
  * @type {( string[] | false )}
  * List of whitelisted links and usernames,
  * For channels and groups to stop warning users for them.
  * Pass false to disable this feature
  */

The remaining settings are about automatic banning after warnings to keep the bots away:

 /**
  * @type {ms}
  * Don't count warns older than this value towards automatic ban.
  * [Look at typedef above for details.]
